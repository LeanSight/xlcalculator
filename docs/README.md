## üéØ Current Focus

The primary focus is on **Excel Compliance Strategy** which outlines the architectural approach to fix dynamic range function issues (ROW, COLUMN, OFFSET, INDIRECT) by implementing proper Excel-like foundations rather than function-specific workarounds.

The **Development Methodology** document provides a project-agnostic foundational framework for all development work, including ATDD compliance, task management, problem resolution approaches, integration testing patterns, implementation strategies, and code quality standards.

The **Excel Compliance Project Goals** document contains the specific objectives, architectural gaps, success criteria, and Excel-specific implementation details for the current Excel compliance initiative.
