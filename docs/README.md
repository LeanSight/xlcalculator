## üéØ Current Focus

The **Excel Compliance Project Goals** document contains the specific objectives, architectural gaps, success criteria, and Excel-specific implementation details for the current Excel compliance initiative.

The **Development Methodology** document provides a project-agnostic foundational framework for all development work, including ATDD compliance, task management, problem resolution approaches, integration testing patterns, implementation strategies, and code quality standards.

The **Architecture Analysis** document provides comprehensive analysis of the current xlcalculator codebase, identifying architectural gaps and design patterns that need to be addressed for Excel compliance.

The **Reference System Design** document outlines the Excel-compatible reference object architecture needed to enable proper context-aware function execution and dynamic reference handling.

The **Function Implementation Guide** document establishes the Outside-In ATDD methodology for implementing Excel functions, starting from official Excel documentation through design documents, JSON test cases, and systematic implementation.
